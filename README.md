# Hello world!

This is the first github pages site that I've created. It's a place for my math notes while in grad school. My goal is to use this place to help me retain the information I learn throughout my time in school, and also to use it as a reference for when I don't* retain something :)

The classes I'm taking this Fall are Deterministic Mathematical Models, Probability Theory and Applications, and Mathematical/Statistical Computing. Once I have some notes typed up, I'll put a "table of contents" type of list here.

Please feel free to use as you wish! 

The layout is the simple "Minimal" jekyll theme that is supported by gh pages.



### Some quotes I like:

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit." - Aristotle

> "Somehow it's okay for people to chuckle about not being good at math. Yet if I said 'I never learned to read,' they'd say I was an illiterate dolt." - Neil DeGrasse Tyson
