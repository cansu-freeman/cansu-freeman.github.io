**Course Description:** A graduate level course in basic applied mathematical modeling with emphasis on derivation and analysis of models via numerical linear algebra and differential equation methods including variational analysis. Includes both ordinary and partial differential equations of first order. Applications of ordinary differential equations include age-structured populations; partial differential studies will be directed towards conservation laws and traffic flow. The course will also provide basic introductions to Matlab and its openware clone Octave. Software and instructional manuals will be available at either modest or no cost. A course in contemporary applied mathematical modeling and computation. Special topics include dimensional analysis, data dimension reduction, SIR models, delay equations, Google page rank, Markov chains and other modern applications.
