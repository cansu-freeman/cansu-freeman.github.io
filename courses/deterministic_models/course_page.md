# Deterministic Mathematical Models 

## The Modelling Cycle

It all starts with a *situation* or a problem. Then we must simplify and represent this problem by answering several questions: What exactly is the problem? What do we already know? What do we need to find out? Can we make it simpler? At this point, we may create a *mathematical model* to analyze and solve our problem. We can create diagrams, perform calculations, compare results, etc. until we come up with our *result*. The solution to our problem isn't the end of the modelling cycle. We must then interpret and evaluate our results. What conclusions can we infer with our results? Is our solution good enough? Can we give a *real world meaning* of our results? If so, then we can report our solutions and share with others. If not, we must start over, simplify, and reorganize.

### General Applications 
- physical systems like fluids, or traffic flow
- mechanical systems like mass-spring or pendulum
- biolgical systems like animal populations or birth-death cycle
- electrical systems like circuits

As you can see, there are several real-world applications that modelled with mathematics. But before we dive deep into these applications, let's refresh our skills in differential equations and linear algebra. Throughout the notes, I assume everyone knows calculus.

----------
<small><b>Course Description</b>: A graduate level course in basic applied mathematical modeling with emphasis on derivation and analysis of models via numerical linear algebra and differential equation methods including variational analysis. Includes both ordinary and partial differential equations of first order. Applications of ordinary differential equations include age-structured populations; partial differential studies will be directed towards conservation laws and traffic flow. The course will also provide basic introductions to Matlab and its openware clone Octave. Software and instructional manuals will be available at either modest or no cost. A course in contemporary applied mathematical modeling and computation. Special topics include dimensional analysis, data dimension reduction, SIR models, delay equations, Google page rank, Markov chains and other modern applications.</small>
