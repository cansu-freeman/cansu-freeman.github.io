# Differential Equations


Please note that this part of the notes are only supposed to be a refresher. They might not include everything that one would typically learn in a differential equation class. A **differential equation** is simply an equation which involves an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. For example: *y' = x + 4y -12*.

## 1. First Order Linear Differential Equations

A first-order linear differential equation is one with which can be written in the standard form: ![firstorder](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{dy}{dt}&space;&plus;a(t)y&space;=&space;b(t)), where a(t) and b(t) are continuous. If b(t) = 0, we call this a **homogenous** first-order lienar differential equation.

**Theorem:** The general solution of the first order linear homogenous equation is:  ![1stOLIDE](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y&space;=&space;ce^{-\int&space;a(t)dt})

**Example:** Find the general solution of dy/dt + ycos(t) = 0.

*First we identify that it is of the form ![firstorder](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{dy}{dt}&space;&plus;a(t)y&space;=&space;b(t)), where b(t) = 0. We can classify this as a first order linear homogenous differential equation where a(t) = cos(t). The general solution is as simple as plugging it in:*

Since a(t) = cos(t), the integral of a(t) is sin(t). Thus the solution is ![math](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y&space;=&space;ce^{-sin(t)}), for all c. This is considered an explicit solution.

**Example:** Find th e general solution of dy/dt + ysin(t) = 0, given that y(pi) =1.

Similar to the problem above, we can compute that the general solution is ![math](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y&space;=&space;ce^{cos(t)}) for all c. But to find the unique solution given by the initial value, we must plug in out value y(pi) = 1. Solved, we get that c = e, so the final unique solution is ![math](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y&space;=&space;ce^{cos(t)+1})



Again, a first order **non-homogenous** differential equation is ![firstorder](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{dy}{dt}&space;&plus;a(t)y&space;=&space;b(t)), where b(t) is NOT equal to 0. We solve these using the Integrating Factor technique.

Integrating Factors of ![firstorder](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{dy}{dt}&space;&plus;a(t)y&space;=&space;b(t)) is defined as ![intfact](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu&space;=&space;e^{\int&space;a(t)&space;dt}). Pro tip: this is similar to the homogenous solution, but without a minus sign and without a constant, c.

**Lemma:** 

![intfact](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{dy}{dt}&space;&plus;a(t)y&space;=&space;b(t)) is defined as ![lemma](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{d(\mu&space;y)}{dt}&space;=&space;\frac{dy}{dt}&space;\mu&space;&plus;&space;a(t)y\mu).

 **Pf:** By the chain rule and product rule,
 
![math](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{d(\mu&space;y)}{dt}&space;=&space;\frac{d\mu}{dt}&space;y&space;&plus;&space;\mu&space;\frac{dy}{dt})

![math](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{d(\mu&space;y)}{dt}&space;=&space;e^{\int&space;a(t)}&space;(\int&space;a(t)dt&space;)'y&space;&plus;&space;\mu&space;\frac{dy}{dt})

![math](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{d(\mu&space;y)}{dt}&space;=&space;\mu&space;a(t)y&space;&plus;&space;\mu&space;\frac{dy}{dt})


q.e.d

This lemma is often a missed middle step when solving differential equations with the integrating factors technique. We use the understanding of this often as you'll see below. Oh by the way, the greet letter: ![mu](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu).


Below is the framework for how to solve first order linear non-homogenous differential equations using the **integrating factor method** after solving for ![mu](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu).

1. Multuply both sides by the integrating factor ![mu](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu) and apply the lemma to rewrite the left-hand side as ![lhs](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{d(\mu&space;y)}{dy}).
2. Integrate both sides with respect to t. By the lemma, the left hand side turns into simply ![mu](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\mu)y.
3. Solve for y.

## 2. Seperable Equations

A **seperable** differential equation is one that can be written in the standard form: ![seperable](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(y)&space;\frac{dy}{dt}&space;=&space;g(t)), where f is a function of y. The goal is to *seperate* variables so the y's are on the left and the t's are on the right. 

Below is the framework for solving seperable differential equations:

1. Integrate both sides with respect to t. (This assumes it is already in standard form)
2. Solve for y

## 3. Second Order Linear Differential Equations

A **second-order linear** differential equation is one that involves have the second derivative within the equation. The simplest type of second order linear homogeneous differential equation are those with **constant coefficiants**. Generally, this looks like ay''+ by' + cy = 0, where a,b,c are constants.

We will seek solutions of the form y = exp(rt), where r is a real number. Let's consider what it means for y = exp(rt) to solve ay''+ by' + cy = 0.
We compute the first and second derivative of y:

![e^rt](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y&space;=&space;e^{rt})

![re^rt](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y'&space;=&space;re^{rt})

![r^2e^rt](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y''&space;=&space;r^{2}e^{rt})

Then if we plug these into ay''+ by' + cy = 0, we have: ![math](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a&space;r^{2}y&space;&plus;&space;bry&space;&plus;&space;cy&space;=&space;0). 

Factoring y on the leftside, we have: [chareq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a&space;r^{2}&space;&plus;&space;by&space;&plus;&space;c&space;=&space;0).

Time for a definition. Given the differential equation with constant coefficients, ay''+ by' + cy = 0, the equation [chareq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a&space;r^{2}&space;&plus;&space;by&space;&plus;&space;c&space;=&space;0) is teh **characteristic equation**. A root of the characterstic equation is any number, r, that solves it. 

**Preposition**: A function y = exp(rt) is a solution of ay''+ by' + cy = 0 if and only id r is a root of the characteristic equation. The infamous quadratic 
equation gives the roots to the characteristic equation. 

![quadraticeq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r&space;=&space;\frac{-b&space;\pm&space;\sqrt{b^{2}&space;-4ac}}{2a})

If ![equals0](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?b^{2}&space;-4ac&space;=&space;0), then there is only one solution.

If ![greater0](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?b^{2}&space;-4ac&space;>&space;0), then both roots will solve it.

If ![less0](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?b^{2}&space;-4ac&space;<&space;0), then there will be two solutions with complex roots.

**Theorem:** Consider the second order linear homogeneous differential equation ay''+ by' + cy = 0. Suppose ![greater0](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?b^{2}&space;-4ac&space;>&space;0), then ![quadraticeq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r_{1}&space;=&space;\frac{-b&space;-&space;\sqrt{b^{2}&space;-4ac}}{2a}) and ![quadraticeq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?r_{2}&space;=&space;\frac{-b&space;plus&space;\sqrt{b^{2}&space;-4ac}}{2a}). Then the general solution is of the form: ![gensol](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y&space;=&space;c_{1}e^{r_{1}t}&space;&plus;&space;c_{2}e^{r_{2}t})
