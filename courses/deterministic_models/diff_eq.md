# Differential Equations

A **differential equation** is simply an equation which involves an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. For example: *y' = x + 4y -12*.

### First Order Linear Differential Equations
---------------------------------------------

A first-order linear differential equation is one with which can be written in the standard form: *dy/dt + a(t)y = b(t)*, where a(t) and b(t) are continuous. If b(t) = 0, we call this a **homogenous** first-order lienar differential equation.

**Theorem:** The general solution of the first order linear homogenous equation is:  ![1stOLIDE](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y&space;=&space;ce^{-\int&space;a(t)dt})

**Example:** Find the general solution of dy/dt + ycos(t) = 0.

*First we identify that it is of the form dy/dt + a(t)y = b(t), where b(t) = 0. We can classify this as a first order linear homogenous differential equation where a(t) = cos(t). The general solution is as simple as plugging it in:*

Since a(t) = cos(t), the integral of a(t) is sin(t). Thus the solution is ![math](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y&space;=&space;ce^{-sin(t)}), for all c. This is considered an explicit solution.

**Example:** Find th e general solution of dy/dt + ysin(t) = 0, given that y(pi) =1.

Similar to the problem above, we can compute that the general solution is ![math](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y&space;=&space;ce^{cos(t)}) for all c. But to find the unique solution given by the initial value, we must plug in out value y(pi) = 1. Solved, we get that c = e, so the final unique solution is ![math](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y&space;=&space;ce^{cos(t)+1})



Again, a first order **non-homogenous** differential equation is *dy/dt + a(t)y = b(t)*, where b(t) is NOT equal to 0. We solve these using the Integrating Factors technique.
